Hello, I'm Haikal, a web developer residing in Indonesia. My passion lies in coding, collaborating on open source projects, and exploring the vast opportunities offered by the web platform.

Beyond my professional responsibilities, I actively engage in creating and contributing to open source projects. This not only enables me to learn extensively and enhance my skills as a developer but also allows me to extend support to other open source initiatives.
